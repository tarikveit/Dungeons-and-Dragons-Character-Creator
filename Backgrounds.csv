Acolyte;I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.|I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.|I see omens in every event and action.

We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world.|Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith’s religious hierarchy.|Faith.

You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.
Acolyte(Luxonborn);I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person’s deeds and example.|I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.|I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.|Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.|I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation.|I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods.|I’ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple’s elite.

But you serve the Luxon, a being that you believe transcends godhood and created the cosmos. No mere priest, you are a student of potential, for the Luxon is potentiality incarnate. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.
Charlatan;I fall in and out of love easily, and am always pursuing someone.|I have a joke for every occasion, especially occasions where humor is inappropriate.|Flattery is my preferred trick for getting what I want.|I’m a born gambler who can’t resist taking a risk for a potential payoff.|I lie about almost everything, even when there’s no good reason to.|Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.|I keep multiple holy symbols on me and invoke whatever deity might come in useful at any given moment.|I pocket anything I see that might have some value.;Independence. I am a free spirit—no one tells me what to do.|Fairness. I never target people who can’t afford to lose a few coins.|Charity. I distribute the money I acquire to the people who really need it.|Creativity. I never run the same con twice.|Friendship. Material goods come and go. Bonds of friendship last forever.|Aspiration. I’m determined to make something of myself.;I fleeced the wrong person and must work to ensure that this individual never crosses paths with me or those I care about.|I owe everything to my mentor—a horrible person who’s probably rotting in jail somewhere.|Somewhere out there, I have a child who doesn’t know me. I’m making the world better for him or her.|I come from a noble family, and one day I’ll reclaim my lands and title from those who stole them from me.|A powerful person killed someone I love. Some day soon, I’ll have my revenge.|I swindled and ruined a person who didn’t deserve it.

You know what makes them tick, you can tease out their hearts’ desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few leading questions you can read them like they were children’s books. It’s a useful talent, and one that you’re perfectly willing to use for your advantage. You know what people want and you deliver, or rather, you promise to deliver. Common sense should steer people away from things that sound too good to be true, but common sense seems to be in short supply when you’re around. The bottle of pink-colored liquid will surely cure that unseemly rash, this ointment — nothing more than a bit of fat with a sprinkle of silver dust — can restore youth and vigor, and there’s a bridge in the city that just happens to be for sale. These marvels sound implausible, but you make them sound like the real deal. Favorite Schemes:

Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.|I don’t pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.|The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can’t do it.|I blow up at the slightest insult.;Honor. I don’t steal from others in the trade.|Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them.|Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need.|Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy.|People.

I’m okay with that.;Blackmailer|Burglar|Enforcer|Fence|Highway robber|Hired killer|Pickpocket|Smuggler;Most criminals in Wildemount are petty thieves and cutpurses who operate out of desperation. You, however, are a criminal of a higher caliber. You are a member of the Myriad, the greatest crime syndicate to ever grace the face of Exandria. You have a network of criminal contacts and allies to help you in your crimes—but you also have rivals and superiors that would gladly throw you to the wolves to save their own skins. The Myriad has bases of operation in every major city outside Eastern Wynandir, even if those bases are made up of only two or three members. Wherever you find the Myriad, you can find temporary shelter from the law—for a price. Criminal Specialty:

Use the first two verses to spread news of death or defeat.;The Golden Grin began in the far-off land of Tal’Dorei, trading secret messages through a network of bards and minstrels to undermine an iron-fisted king’s authoritarian rule. Today, Tal’Dorei is a relatively peaceful republic, and some Grinners have grown restless while waiting for tyranny to raise its ugly head again. A contingent of such Grinners traveled to the Menagerie Coast and set up a network of secret bases in the cities of the Clovis Concord, from which they are presently working their way into the highest echelons of the Dwendalian Empire. You are a Grinner. Your goals are to spread freedom and inspire hope—or, in time, revolution—in the hearts of the oppressed. Favorite Code-Song:

We all have the same blood.|My favor, once lost, is lost forever.|If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your fields.;Respect. Respect is due to me because of my position, but all people regardless of station deserve to be treated with dignity. |Responsibility.

You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them. A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature (see the sidebar) instead of the Position of Privilege feature. One of your commoner retainers is replaced by a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood. Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).

Or you could be an honest, hard-working landowner who cares deeply about the people who live and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.

Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you’ve garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.

Its operations are primarily based out of the cities of Zadash and Rexxentrum in the Dwendalian Empire, and you likely studied at one of those sites. As a rank-and-file pupil of the Cobalt Soul, you adventure to help expand your mind. Alternatively (and with the DM’s permission), you might also take on a more specific role within the organization. Expositors are secret agents who gather information in the field, while archivists are the curators who ensure the well-being of the Cobalt Soul’s many Archives. Monks of the Cobalt Soul are enlightened scholars who lead expeditions into ancient and forgotten places, hoping to reclaim their lost knowledge and history. Specialty:

The Revelry doesn’t take kindly to traitors and deserters, so if you count yourself a former member of that crew, you’ll want to watch your back while traveling on the Menagerie Coast. Thugs might hassle you and your allies until you even the score with the Revelry, either by paying up, submitting to imprisonment, or proving that you’re too dangerous to tangle with.
